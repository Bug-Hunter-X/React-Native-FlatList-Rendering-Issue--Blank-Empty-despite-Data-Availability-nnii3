# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug in React Native's FlatList component where it renders blank or empty despite having data available. This issue is often difficult to debug because it doesn't trigger typical errors.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent.js` file contains a FlatList that should render a list of items. However, even though data is successfully passed to the component, the FlatList remains blank.

## Solution

The `MyComponentSolution.js` file provides a solution to fix the issue. The key is to ensure that the data prop is updated correctly and that the `keyExtractor` prop provides unique keys for each item in the data array. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app on your emulator or device using `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the blank FlatList in `MyComponent.js`.
5. Compare the solution in `MyComponentSolution.js` to understand and fix the issue.
